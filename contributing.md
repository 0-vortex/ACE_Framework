# Contributing to ACE_Framework

At present time, I am not looking for contributors. All unsolicited PRs will be unceremoniously rejected. Repeat offenders will be blocked. 

Good faith issues and discussions are welcome. Trolls, potshots, and bad faith message swill result in immediate bans. 

Play nice. I don't have time for your nonsense. 

Refer to C3P0 for more understanding of this zero tolerance policy: https://github.com/daveshap/C3P0 

TLDR any one who wastes time will be banned.
